<p>(Last Updated: Nov 19, 2022)</p>

<p>I'm a Pre-doctoral Researcher at <a herf="https://research.google/locations/india/">Google Research India</a> in the Machine Learning and Optimization team lead by <a href="https://www.prateekjain.org/">Dr. Prateek Jain</a>. </p>

<p>I graduated from the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Department at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB), where my undergraduate thesis on methods to train ML models for future unseen data was advised by <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sunita/"> Prof. Sunita Sarawagi </a> and <a href="https://abir-de.github.io/">Prof. Abir De </a>. I also worked with <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/"> Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan </a> on parsing and with <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~nutan/"> Prof. Nutan Limaye </a> on theoretical foundations of transfer learning. Head over to the publications page to find a list of works I have contributed to. </p>

<!-- My current supervisors include [Dr. Sriparna Saha](https://www.iitp.ac.in/~sriparna/) (Associate Professor, IIT Patna), [Dr. Pushpak Bhattacharyya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/) (Professor, IIT Bombay), [Dr. Adam Jatowt](https://adammo12.github.io/adamjatowt/) (Associate Professor, Kyoto University), [Dr. GaÃ«l H. Dias](https://dias.users.greyc.fr/) (Professor, University of Caen Normandie), and [Dr. Mohammed Hasanuzzaman](https://mohammedhasanuzzaman.github.io/) (Lecturer, Cork Institute of Technology). -->

<p>My research interests include fundamental ML problems around understanding theoretically and empirically what deep neural networks learn, and using these insights to make them more robust and compute-efficient.</p>

<!-- <p><bold>Life aspiration</bold>: I wish to utilize my research experience to improve the current education landscape, contributing towards the fundamental <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/education/">right to education</a>.<p> -->
